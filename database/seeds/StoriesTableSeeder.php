                'story' => 'Yoo hoo! Grandma! It’s only me!” Rosa called, bustling into the light and warmth of the only room in the small stone cottage.\r\n\r\n“Mum’s sent you some beef stew,” she dumped her basket on the solid oak table, hung her red cloak on the back of the door and smoothed down her blue chequered school dress before busying herself by the huge iron bedstead on the far side of the room.\r\n\r\n“Here, Grandma,” crooned Rosa propping the old dear up on plumped pillows.\r\n\r\n“You are so bony,” she remarked. “Shall I get you some stew?”\r\n\r\n“No thanks, child, I’ll eat later,” barked Grandma, her voice deep and tuneless, like a saxophone full of gravel.\r\n\r\n“Oh, and Jack got you some more of that chicken broth for your sore throat,” Rosa continued, pulling back the covers to reveal a thin bandaged leg poking abruptly from an ankle length, pure white, nightgown.\r\n\r\n“Blasted woodcutter and his meddling axe,” groaned Grandma, inspecting the wounded leg with wide-eyed fearful curiosity.\r\n\r\n“What was that?” asked Rosa absent-mindedly.\r\n\r\n“I said, that’s good dear. Your mum and Jack, permanent is it?”\r\n\r\n“They’re so embarrassing,” Rosa blushed. “They don’t even notice me when they’re doing all that kissy stuff,” she tutted. “Your leg’s still swollen,” she remarked, neat fingers picking and pulling at the blood-stained bandage.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about the outside world child, I sit here alone all day.” Grandma winced as Rosa cleaned the wound.\r\n\r\n“You know Tom Godby, the minister’s son?” Rosa said coyly.\r\n\r\n“That great lumbering fool,” Grandma folded scrawny arms across her chest.\r\n\r\n“Well,” interrupted Rosa breathlessly,” I think he’s going to ask me tonight! And if he does, I shall say yes,” she took a deep breath and continued. “Grandma, you know how Mum feels about the minister.”\r\n\r\n“Tis the minister’s job to punish unmarried sinners, child.”\r\n\r\nIn a theatrical flourish Grandma crossed herself and put her hands together in prayer. For a moment Rosa stopped and stared open-mouthed. Then she noticed the twinkle in Grandma’s eye. They erupted in girly giggles, a soprano and a baritone in simultaneous harmony.\r\n\r\n“I hope you don’t mind,” continued Rosa regardless, “I’ve asked Tom to meet me here.”\r\n\r\nGrandma took a deep breath and a long black tongue flicked across her lips.\r\n\r\n“Can I get changed here Grandma? It won’t take a mo. Then I’ll get your supper.”\r\n\r\nHer grandmother nodded her consent.\r\n\r\n“Thanks Grandma!” She gave her grandmother’s thin, bony, hairy hand an excited squeeze. “Remind me to trim your nails before I go,” she remarked casually.\r\n\r\nRosa quickly changed behind the curtain that separated the living and sleeping areas of the cottage.\r\n\r\n“Well, will I do?” she said, re-appearing with a dancer’s twirl.\r\n\r\n“Like a lamb to the slaughter,” muttered Grandma grimly.\r\n\r\n“What did you say?” puzzled Rosa.\r\n\r\n“Like a bride at the altar child, you look good enough to eat,” she rummaged around under her mattress and pulled out a string of pearls, shiny and translucent white in the candlelight. “They are a family heirloom, child. About time you had them.”\r\n\r\n“Grandma, they’re so beautiful!” Rosa held it to her neck. “Do it up for me please.”\r\n\r\n“I call them my pearls of wisdom, child,” explained Grandmother, fumbling clumsily with the clasp. “Twenty four pearls, all individually selected by me.”\r\n\r\nRosa walked over to the wardrobe and admired the pearls. Each pearl shone as if it had a life of its own, each slightly different in colour and lustre. Each as beautiful as the next.\r\n\r\nThe powerful beauty of the necklace made Rosa feel different; alert and perceptive. The room seemed to shimmer and ripple as a pebble thrown into a pond, it shifted and changed like a theatre curtain lifting to reveal a new scene. And what a scene.\r\n\r\nRosa noticed the dark, dirty poverty of the room; the bony left-overs of meals strewn in dank corners; the stink of animal that almost made her retch.\r\n\r\n“Grandma your ears, your teeth, they’re all different!”\r\n\r\nThis was the last remark she ever made…\r\n\r\nWalking nervously through the darkening forest Tom Godby thought he heard the scream of a barn owl. He didn’t notice the svelte figure of a wolf limping off into the trees. He didn’t hear the choking sound as the wolf coughed up a blonde hairball and picked a small, white pearl from the centre of it.\r\n\r\n“Twenty-five,” noted the wolf, threading a new pearl on to his necklace. “Now to find twenty-six.',

                'story' => "Auld Tam Gourley lay in the bed nearest the door of the ward. He had fallen into the coma that would end his days - only a few hours were left to him. To any who observed, he was entering that state of death with dignity. He breathed in deeply and exhaled loudly, and slight nervous twitches showed upon his tired, old face. His mind was active and reliving all his life’s experiences, and as each event occurred, so the relevant expression appeared upon his face.\r\n\r\n“Mr Gourley.” The student nurse’s voice tried to break into his coma.\r\n\r\n“Mr Gourley.” He heard but could not react.\r\n\r\n‘Poor girl,’ he thought. ‘She is trying so hard, and she’s so young.’ He could feel the coolness of her comforting hand on his forehead.\r\n\r\n`“Mr Gourley, I’m going to wash your face now,” the voice said, just before the wash sponge touched his face.\r\n\r\nThe roughness of the towel rasped sensations through the skin of his face, causing his eyelids to flutter.\r\n\r\n“Mr Gourley. Sister, Sister, Mr Gourley’s coming round.”\r\n\r\n“Nurse, leave the poor man alone,” said the old Nursing Sister. “You’re young, girl, you’ll learn. He’s in a final coma. He’ll not ‘come round’, as you put it, nor can he hear you. Just let him slip off in peace.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Sister,” was all the nurse could find to say.\r\n\r\nTam lay, his brain registering every word she said, but he was physically unable to signal a word of comfort to the young nurse.\r\n\r\n“Poor child,” he thought. “She’ll surely just have to learn, as we all have to.” A pleasant thought entered his mind and he forgot what he’d heard.\r\n\r\n“Tam Gourley, you wicked devil, how dare you!” chastised the girl he had made eyes at all night. “Just because you’re all dressed up to go to the front line and fight for King and Country, it doesn’t give you the right to take liberties.”\r\n\r\n“Come on, Agnes, give us a kiss,” said Tam, pulling her closer.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing struggle caused him to want her even more. His strong hands encircled the whalebone-corseted waist like a vice. He kissed her with abandonment, until there was no fight left in her and she gave herself to him.\r\n\r\nSweet Agnes’s surrender wasn’t the only memory to be relived in his hospital bed. The cold mud of France penetrated the thick woollen overcoat he wore as he lay out in no-man’s land. He had crawled out under cover of darkness until he found himself a concealed firing position. His task was to remain hidden for the next six hours, his orders to kill a senior German officer who was known to be visiting the front line.\r\n\r\nTam Gourley was one of the Regiment’s finest shots and had undergone intensive training to perfect his killing art. Not so the art of making love, he thought, as his mind went back over the events with Agnes once again. Up to that moment, they had both been virgins, but that hadn’t mattered. When he had left her, he had felt man enough to fight a dozen wars.\r\n\r\nHour after hour dragged slowly past as he lay motionless. Any movement on his part could betray his position. His body was slowly becoming colder and wetter, until only the warmth of the passing of urine heated his legs.\r\n\r\n“Nurse.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sister?”\r\n\r\n“One of the things that occurs when the body is in a terminal coma is that the bladder loses control. Make sure he is kept dry and comfortable, and don’t fuss unduly. Now just change his sheets and pads.”\r\n\r\n“But, Sister…”\r\n\r\n“Do only what you are told, Nurse.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, Sister.”\r\n\r\n‘God,’ thought Tam. ‘I surely would enjoy a pint and a whisky right now.’ It was a pleasant passing thought as he lay entrenched in the mud. He did not feel hungry - only thirsty. But any movement would be spotted, so he couldn’t attempt to drink from the water bottle.\r\n\r\n“His lips seem dry. Can I moisten them, Sister?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Nurse. It won’t do him any harm.”\r\n\r\nTam pressed his dry lips down on the mud and enjoyed the comfort of the liquid that he dared not swallow. The ground could contain poison of some kind, such as gas, old blood, decayed flesh or vermin droppings. ‘If only I could feel again the moisture of your lips, Agnes,’ he thought, ‘I would thirst no more.’\r\n\r\nRisking a slight movement of his head, he looked over to the German lines.\r\n\r\n“Nurse, wipe Mr Gourley’s eyes, and clean the spittle from his face.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, Sister.”\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing directly into his eyes, the freezing blast making them water, but he could just see a movement, the fussing of junior officers and senior NCOs organising their men into position for the expected arrival of an officer from General Staff.\r\n\r\n“This is what I’ve been waiting for,” thought Tam, as slowly he eased the rifle forward, inch by inch, each minute movement carefully planned. The rifle he was using was the latest, high-powered Lee Enfield 7.62 calibre, with recoil springs housed in the butt cushion. His ammunition was extra grained powder, and the bullet was made of tungsten steel - designed to penetrate a steel helmet. the telescopic sights were honed in to strike at the point of aim. Tam had spent many hours and countless rounds of ammunition on the range to ensure his sights were perfectly aligned.\r\n\r\nWith the rifle fitting snugly into his shoulder, he sighted down the telescope to find his target.\r\n\r\n“Nurse.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, Sister?”\r\n\r\n“Stay with Mr Gourley, I fear the time is near. Is this your first death?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, Sister,” she answered, sadly fearful of what was expected of her. Her training had covered this eventuality: now she had to face it in practice.\r\n\r\n“Well, Nurse, this is one duty that training school can do nothing to prepare you for. You’ll see plenty more of the same in your career, but remember your first will govern how you handle it in the future.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sister.”\r\n\r\n“Right you are then: give of your best.”\r\n\r\nTam lay tensed up now, the cold and dampness forgotten. Only the next few minutes ahead would count - his first assassination. Looking through his telescopic sight he surveyed the enemy trench works. He could see soldiers much like himself: dirty, unshaven, uniforms covered in mud, clasping rifles with bayonets at the ready. Only the colour of the uniform differed. Was it right that such men should kill one another? Several officers moved along the trench and approached the forward viewing ramp. Then Tam spotted his target: a tall portly man with short-clipped hair protruding from under his spiked helmet, his puffy heavy-jowelled face sporting a large walrus moustache. The collar decoration on his uniform revealed the fact that he was a staff officer of very high rank. This was it.\r\n\r\nTam held the rifle rock-steady as the cross hairs of his sight came to rest on the centre of the man’s face.\r\n\r\n“Hush, Mr Gourley. You are with me. We’ll see this through together.” said the young nurse, taking Tam’s right hand She stroked it gently, mainly to calm her own nerves.\r\n\r\nTam felt his right hand go itchy and rubbed it on the stubble of his beard. His mouth felt dry. He re-sighted onto his target. Gently, without disturbing his aim, he applied pressure to the trigger. Slowly the trigger moved back until the first pressure was taken up. Tam re-adjusted his sight, tightened his grip on the rifle, and added the final pressure to the trigger. The rifle bucked into his shoulder and the loud report of the detonation shattered the silence of the morning air. Through the telescopic sight, Tam saw the bullet strike the target.\r\n\r\nThe nurse sat staring into Tam’s face. At the moment of death, she was sure she had felt the pressure of a finger movement against her hand.\r\n\r\n“Is it over, Nurse?”\r\n\r\n“I fear it is,” answered the nurse.\r\n\r\n“Did it go well?”\r\n\r\n“It did, Sister. It was a first time for both of us.”\r\n\r\n“Then he is at peace, and you are a much better nurse.”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” was all the nurse could say.",

                'story' => "They say that when you die all the trousers you’ve ever owned flash past. In Derek’s case this happened every day. At forty three years old, he was still an active trouser buyer, and his collection was ever growing.\r\n\r\nTonight Derek was meeting Hilary. He noted from her web entry that she was a big fan of The Damned, found out when their first single was released, and went straight into his seventies room. But where was the 1976 rack? It was nowhere to be seen. He’d been fifteen in 1976 and, if anything, had increased his trouser buying in an attempt, along with the care and nurture of his fluffy Zappa moustache, to attract girls.\r\n\r\nHe rummaged through the other racks. Maybe he had combined it with another year? But there was no sign. He wondered whether his mother had been moving things about, and shuddered, remembering the time she de-alphabetized his packet soups.\r\n\r\nThis gap in the collection was a devastating blow, not only to his meeting with Hilary. The integrity of his whole curatorial policy would be undermined if he didn’t find 1976. 1976 was an exceptionally interesting year for trousers. It was on the cusp of glam-rock and punk, between baggy flares and drainpipes. It was one of those years (and you only get this phenomenon once or twice a decade) where there was a transitional trouser – in this case, a cut somewhere between a baggy leg and a slim drainpipe. It had been ingenious and could pass for baggy from the front and drainpipe from the side. Derek had owned two pairs of these, as well as various northern soul parallels and several slim cut Wranglers later in the year when punk was really taking off.\r\n\r\nHe riffled through 1975, but it was no use; some checked oxford bags he’d worn with platforms and stripy socks, and some stay-pressed which shimmered when viewed from different angles. 1977 was no better, with its bondage trousers and tartan straight legs. None of these would do. Hilary would notice immediately- a few weeks either way could give you away in the late seventies, trouser fashion moved at such a relentless pace.\r\n\r\nLater that night he found himself humming New Rose whilst he organised his apple stickers. The evening had gone well. When he’d stood up to shake her hand Hilary had looked down at his legs and gasped. She had been amazed at so much attention to detail. In fact, it was an even better effect than if he had managed to find the right trousers. She’d been so overwhelmed with emotion that she couldn’t continue with the date.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, thinking of the old Derek charm winding her in. Debenhams, 1976 – the power of the Y-front.\r\n\r\n",

                'title' => "The Unintended Gazpacho",
                'story' => "It was one of those blisteringly hot, late summer afternoons. The heat shimmered above the scrubby, golden grass at the edge of the vegetable plot, where a couple of goats, tethered to a post nipped mercilessly at the dry tufts. Frustrated by the lack of verdure, they leapt up onto a dry stone wall, damaging it in the process, to reach the faint green of an overhanging olive branch.\r\n\r\nApart from the chomping of the goats, the countryside was silent. Not a bird sang. All was quiet; that is, except for the snoring which came from a small stone hut.\r\n\r\nUntil about two o’clock it had been cool enough to work, and Felix Gomez Gomez had been gathering tomatoes from his orchard. Many of them were the smaller ones, and a few were pear shaped. These he would bottle for his own consumption and some would be for Lula. She paid him reasonably well for them, in fact sometimes absent mindedly, a little too handsomely. Today he had also picked some prime specimens, large irregular beef tomatoes, which were so good, just diced and sprinkled with rock salt. He knew that Lula would appreciate them. She was one of the few who talked to him nowadays, he liked her for it, and besides, he felt somehow that there was a small chance of some physical comfort with her. His life was otherwise a lonely one exacerbated by alcoholism.\r\n\r\nLunch had consisted of a bottle of red wine and gazpacho; stale bread, olive oil and tomatoes, cucumbers, garlic and peppers, bashed up roughly with a wooden pestle in a cork bowl, and moistened with water from the pottery cántaro on the shelf in the corner. A slice or two of cheese had helped the last of the wine coax him into a somnolent trance.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was probably younger than he looked, he was a diminutive wizened old man in appearance, with two crooked teeth, and a leathery, unshaven face. He slept his siesta in the relatively cool interior of his hut. His head had fallen forward onto his wine-stained shirt and the greasy flat cap, which otherwise never left his head, had fallen onto the cobbled floor. A couple of flies circled spasmodically above him as though savouring the pungent aroma of sweat which emanated from the open neck of his frayed shirt.\r\n\r\nAn observer from the village would have been surprised at his full head of hair. He was never to be seen without the flat cap, and the general assumption was that he was bald on top. No one was certain how old he was, least of all he himself.\r\n\r\nHe had been orphaned before the Spanish civil war, and all through it he had been cared for by the impoverished village community, along with the other waifs and strays. He remembered eating the weeds and plants which grew in the countryside, and in winter they were cooked up over a fire of olive prunings into a bitter porridge together with the rough meal obtained with difficulty from patches of oats, barley or wheat. Sometimes there were beans or chickpeas but not often, and those who were fortunate enough to own a hen or two were careful not to let them out until they had checked with a finger to see whether they had laid an egg or not.\r\n\r\nAfter the war there were few men left in El Castaño de Guzmán. Some had died; some were in prison, which was much the same thing; others had been obliged to migrate to the north in search of work. Those who remained were the wounded, and the weak, and those too young to have been involved. Even years after the end of the second world war there had been a continued exodus of men seeking work in France, Germany and Britain, some of them the companions of his childhood and his youth.\r\n\r\nFor Felix nothing much had changed since the brief unsuccessful flirtation with democracy which had been the second republic; there had been poverty then as there was after the civil war and it would continue to exist in this corner of Spain for many decades.\r\n\r\nAs a young man, Felix had learned to keep himself in pocket by smuggling coffee into Spain from Portugal. He and his fellow contrabandists had had to struggle their way along the rough mountain trails with huge sacks of beans on their backs, tethered to esparto grass slings passed over their foreheads. Sometimes those fortunate enough to possess a mule or a donkey had been able to use them, but it was a risk to take beasts of burden for they were expensive and made easy targets for the guns of the border police. It had been a hard life, dodging the bullets of the Guardia Civil even for a young man, and besides he had grown up malnourished and his legs were bowed from childhood rickets.\r\n\r\nAll that was long over. Even now, new drains and mains water per being piped through the village. Also, he had the comfort of red wine. He could fill his belly from the small orchard and vegetable patch which had been left to him by his parents, and he had a rough whitewashed house of one room on the edge of the village. It had a fireplace with an iron cooking pot, and a courtyard at the back where his parents had kept a donkey. He often wished he had a donkey, but he could not afford it. He’d had one once, just after he had given up the coffee smuggling, when he was still flush with money, and before the drink had taken a hold of him. He had kept the donkey for ten years, but then one spring, when the cistus was bursting into bloom he had gambled it away during a binge drinking session from which he had awoken deathly white and shaking, frozen with cold, and lying in a ditch ten kilometres from home. He could remember nothing about getting there, nor of losing his donkey, but it was at just about the same time of year that the gipsy tribe camped down by the stream on their way north to the big horse fair, and by the time he had recovered sufficiently to investigate, the gipsies were gone, and the ashes of their fire long since cold.\r\n\r\nLike most people in the village, Felix collected jam jars and old juice bottles for preserving the produce of his orchard, and when he returned to the village with his wheelbarrow full of tomatoes, he would lay them out carefully on the newspaper covered earthen floor. Over the next few days he would return to the orchard again and again until he had collected the whole crop. Then he would start to boil water over the fire in his iron pan; he’d dip the tomatoes into it, peel them quickly, and then press them with a wooden spoon into the glass jars. When he had ten or twelve jars filled to the brim, he would screw on the lids, and plunge the jars into the hot water. He’d bring them back up to the boil and simmer them for half an hour or so, then allow them to cool. Thus, over several days he preserved his crop for the winter and the following spring, and in November he would be able to make a stew of pig’s liver and tomato, onions and oregano, when he killed his pig. The onions were still in the ground, and he had picked the oregano and dried it in June.\r\n\r\nFelix woke with a start from his slumber. He was still a little groggy from the wine. He needed a cup of coffee. He stood slowly, and bent to pick his cap off the floor. He tidied away the remains of his lunch onto a high stone shelf, and he hung the three legged stool onto a wooden peg in the stone wall. Light filtered in through the chinks between the loose tiles of the roof. He checked there was enough water in the pottery jug for tomorrow, and went out into the glare of the afternoon. He untied the goats from the wooden post and led them into the cool of the hut, shutting the door firmly behind them. In the pigsty next door he tipped some of last year’s acorns into the trough, along with a handful of maize and a huge roughly chopped ochre-fleshed pumpkin, which the pig attacked eagerly, slurping and crunching his way through the thick dark green skin.\r\n\r\nWearily Felix picked up the handles of the great wheelbarrow. His prize beef tomatoes perched on top of a mountain of lesser fruit. It was a wonderful sight, this scarlet mountain as he teetered along the lane and out into the middle of the quiet country road which skirted the village. It was a quiet road, unfrequented by any vehicle save the odd mule cart and twice a day the bus passed by, not necessarily stopping unless there was post or a passenger for El Castaño de Guzmán, which was a rare occurrence. Here there was a bar, La Parada, which was where the morning and afternoon buses could stop on their way between Huelva and Badajoz. Although the people of the village were some distance from the main road, the limited public transport was obliged to divert for the two or three pueblos which lay along this side route.\r\n\r\nThis was where Felix intended to take his cup of strong black coffee, accompanied by a shot of brandy. It was his habitual afternoon heart-starter, and would return him once more to the land of the living. At present he wandered along in a slightly befuddled condition, yet proudly aware of his mountain of tomatoes. His greatest pride and pleasure lay in the excellent specimens which rode along perched majestically like maharajas on their elephants, above the common throng. He could imagine Lula smiling as she took them from him, and she would surely ask him into the house for some refreshment.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that this was the eve of the day that four village boys had come of age and were off to do their military service on the morrow. The little group, was known as a quinto and they were merry, these boys, because they had been drinking for two days, not merely to give them the courage to leave the pueblo but because last night had been the second night of the village fiesta. As Felix hove unsteadily into view, wheeling his barrow along the raised hump which was the centre of the road, it occurred to one of the young men that it would be a splendid jape to run out into the road and give old Gonzalez Gonzalez a bit of a fright.\r\n\r\nWith hoots of laughter the young men ran out, dancing around Felix, and urging him to drink from their bottle. One of them gave the barrow a high spirited little nudge, and over it went, spilling its scarlet cargo all over the road. Felix let go the handle and raised his hands in the air “¡Ay,mis tomates!” he cried running around in circles, much to the amusement of the four young men. Felix was obviously distressed, he started to run here and there, picking up the tomatoes in apparent panic.\r\n\r\n“Come on old man, join us for a drink. They’re only tomatoes!”\r\n\r\n”Yes, join us for a drink, Gomez Gomez....the tomatoes can wait, we’ll pick them up later.”\r\n\r\n“but, but....”spluttered Felix, for he knew what he was on about. It was that time of day.\r\n\r\nOne of the boys at least had had the decency to rescue the wheel barrow and the few tomatoes which remained in it, and he’d pushed it to the side of the road. The distant drone of an approaching motor could be heard, but the young men were singing loudly now, arms around each other’s shoulders in a fraternal spirit. They gathered Felix into the circle. He cast his eyes behind him anxiously and suddenly there was the blare of a horn, and they sprung into the scrubby hedge. The afternoon bus roared by, splattering its way through the tomatoes, and leaving behind it an unintended gazpacho.\r\n\r\n",

                'story' => "I was one of the first children in Germany to get a blackbird. I think it happened around the time of the bombing, although it’s hard to be sure. The birds hardly ever announced their arrival; you would just realize, one day, that one had been staring at you for a long time, the way you realize a room has gone silent. But I think I can pinpoint the birth of mine, in the last year of the war, in Berlin, when people all over the city started whistling in admiration. “WHHHEEeee.” We were eating dinner, but my mother rushed us outside anyway. I understood when I saw the lights in the sky. I could see why people were whistling.\r\n\r\n“Look, Mama,” I cried. “How did they get those Christmas trees to fly?”\r\n\r\nMama laughed and then stopped herself. She looked at me. I couldn’t understand how she could laugh and look so sad at the same time. But I don’t think that’s when my blackbird came. I think it came in the next moment, when a Christmas tree landed on our house and blew it into pieces, and my mother, still with that sad look on her face, flew up and away into little pieces just like the house. That’s when my blackbird was born.\r\n\r\nI got one of the first blackbirds because I was just the right age. I wasn’t old enough to understand while the war was on. And those who were, never got a blackbird. They had other concerns. To get a blackbird, you had to start understanding when the war was over, when it was too late to do anything. That’s why mine was one of the first; I grew old enough to understand almost immediately after it had ended. I mean, of course, that I was the first to notice my blackbird. They started following us long before we could understand. Once you saw it, once you started understanding, you would see it in your memories as well, and wonder how you’d missed it all that time. I see it, my blackbird, in the memories I have of the bombing; it’s a small gliding speck, high over the heads of the Russian soldiers marching into Berlin; it’s perched, with ruffled feathers, on a suitcase resting next to a spectral refugee from Dresden; its yellow beak and polished black eyes peer out from the gloom of a secret room in the workshop of a family friend.\r\n\r\nI know the older ones never got blackbirds because my father never had one, even after he came back safely from the war in the East. He was thinner than I remembered and he’d lost more of his hair, but he laughed at seeing my little brother and me, and he cried on hearing about Mama and the Christmas tree. He promised us that we would get a new house and make everything the way it was before, although I could hardly remember before, and we would make Mama so proud of our strong family. I hadn’t yet noticed the blackbirds then, but I now know this wasn’t the behaviour of a man who had one following him around. That’s how I know it was just my generation.\r\n\r\nMy father told us all about the war. He told us about a country so cold, you could die if you breathed deeply, and the freezing air reached your heart, and about the enemy who came thick as an Egyptian plague, and about the picture of us he looked at to give him courage and to remember why he was fighting.\r\n\r\n“Did you shoot at people, Papa?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Üschi, and they shot at me. That’s what men do in a war.”\r\n\r\n“Were you frightened?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, but you would have been proud of me. I always did the right thing, even when it was difficult. Not everyone had the stomach for it, but I stepped up and volunteered. That’s how I got promoted.”\r\n\r\n“What did you have to do, Papa? What did you have the stomach for?”\r\n\r\nPapa lit a cigarette. We were sitting on the foundations of our old house. I wasn’t allowed to play in the rubble that covered the city but Papa let me sort through our old things to see if there was anything left we could use.\r\n\r\n“Some of the duties were only for the real soldiers,” he said. “If you proved you were truly dedicated, they would give you the special duties and you would get a promotion.”\r\n\r\n“What duties?”\r\n\r\nPapa rose and turned back to the hollow of our home. “Come, Üschi,” he said. “Time we attend to our duties here.”\r\n\r\nThat was when my blackbird flew back to me. It was perched on a stone by my father’s knee. I saw it when I noticed there was a gap between what my father knew and what he told me, and I felt that the bird had somehow flown through that gap. Except the bird had been perched there for a long time. Maybe since my mother had flown into the sky on that spot.\r\n\r\nIn the years after the war, as I grew older and got on with living in peacetime, I hardly noticed the bird anymore. All of the work we put into rebuilding, the deprivations, the occupying forces, I accepted it as part of the new reality. I grew to recognize others with blackbirds following them around. I saw children, younger than I was, grow up, and as understanding dawned on them, they would notice their blackbirds too. They multiplied, flying out of all the things our parents left unsaid.\r\n\r\nIt was only years later, once the rubble had been cleared and we were stable again, that the blackbird started to irritate me. It was all that remained of the war, but it wouldn’t go away. It grew heavy.\r\n\r\nAt first, I tried to ignore it, but that only made it worse. It felt slighted, and took to demanding attention. It would hide behind, say, a sign at a memorial site, and then leap out, cawing, swatting my face with its wings. So I took a different tack. I gave it all the attention it wanted. I spent years nursing it, indulging it, keeping it close. I volunteered with Jewish charities. I voted liberal. I even made a pilgrimage to Israel.\r\n\r\nIt was in Israel that I had a revelation. My travelling companion and I were walking, and I set out to cross a road. I didn’t see the truck coming, about to run me over, but my friend did, and he shouted for me to stop. “Halt!” he cried out. I did stop, and in the next moment we heard the sound of smashing glass. It came from behind us. We turned to see an old Israeli woman lying unconscious on the side walk, a broken bottle of milk at her side. I saw a number tattooed on her outstretched wrist, and I knew what had happened. The blackbird fluttered around her, cawing, splashing milk. We spoke an evil tongue, one she had escaped, and here we had brought it to her in the least likely place, at the least likely moment. She fainted on the spot.\r\n\r\nI knew after that, that I would never be rid of the blackbird. But still hoped I might be able to pass it on.\r\n\r\nThe blackbird, I reasoned, was a gift. My father had given it to me. That was why, when I discovered I was pregnant, I took it upon myself to learn my father’s secrets. He had died years earlier, but in his papers I found the name of his unit. By then, there were libraries and museums dedicated to the secrets of the war – I wasn’t the only person of my generation to develop a penchant for research. Maybe the others had had the same thought. I pieced together my father’s story and I learned what he’d had the stomach for. Not everybody got a promotion like his. It was reserved for those with a sense of duty so strong that they could volunteer to do the dirty work, and willingly set their humanity aside to carry out the wishes of their Leader. They loved their country so much that they personally lined up the prisoners, the inferior people from that frigid country and personally pulled the trigger. Then personally buried the dead like turds in a latrine hole.\r\n\r\nI discovered my father’s secret so I could bury it again. After you were born, I hid his papers and bit my tongue, and I told you to be proud of your grandfather, and the blackbird flew through the gap in my words. Now I watch your eyes for understanding. And every time I see you tell a friend that your family was different, every time I see you come home from school with questions on your face that you never ask, I see the blackbird fly a little farther from me, and closer to you.\r\n\r\n",
